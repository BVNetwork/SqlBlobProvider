= Blob Provider for SQL Server =
Store all blobs in the database instead of disk.

Easy deployment in load balanced environments, perfect for development teams, avoids committing your blobs into source control too.

This is - conceptually - the same as the Database File System for previous CMS versions. See [/p/epicode/wiki/DatabaseFileSystem] for more information.

Also works for EPiServer Commerce as the assets are stored as regular media.
