= Blob Provider for SQL Server =
Store all blobs in the database instead of disk.

Easy deployment in load balanced environments, perfect for development teams, avoids committing your blobs into source control too.

This is - conceptually - the same as the Database File System for previous CMS versions. See [/p/epicode/wiki/DatabaseFileSystem] for more information.

Also works for EPiServer Commerce as the assets are stored as regular media.

== Installation ==
If installed via NuGet, EPiServerFramework.config should be automatically transformed with the correct blob provider settings. If you need to change it manually, simply add the following to EPiServerFramework.config:
{{{
#!text/xml
<blob defaultProvider="sqlBlobProvider">
    <providers>
      <add name="sqlBlobProvider" type="EPiCode.SqlBlobProvider.SqlBlobProvider, EPiCode.SqlBlobProvider" />
    </providers>
</blob>
}}}

== Migration == 
If you are installing the SqlBlobProvider in an existing project that already uses the standard file blob provider, you will need to convert existing FileBlobs into SqlBlobs. This can easily be done with EPiCode.BlobConverter.This contains a scheduled job, which will convert all file blobs into the currently configured blob type. The conversion tool is not restricted to the SqlBlobProvider, so you could use it for other blob types as well.

== Support ==
This is an unsupported module. Use at your own risk.
